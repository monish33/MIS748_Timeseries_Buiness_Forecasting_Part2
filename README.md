# Sales and Customer Forecasting Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive analysis of sales and customer data, including data preparation, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and time series forecasting. The project aims to develop predictive models and extract insights from a dataset of sales and customer information from a hypothetical superstore.

## Overview
This project's primary goals are to develop predictive models for sales and customer counts and to analyze and extract insights from a comprehensive dataset. The analysis spans from data preparation and exploratory data analysis to the development and evaluation of various time series forecasting models.

## Data Source and Data Preparation
- The raw dataset, obtained from Kaggle, contains sales information from a fictitious superstore.
- Data preparation involves loading the dataset, renaming columns, and transforming date variables for time-based analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- The EDA section explores the dataset to uncover patterns, relationships, and characteristics.
- Visualizations, such as line graphs and auto-correlation functions, are used to understand the dynamics of sales and customer data.

## Descriptive Analysis
- The descriptive analysis section explores overall monthly sales and customer counts from 2014 to 2017.
- Time series line graphs and autocorrelation functions (ACFs) are used to visualize trends, seasonality, and autocorrelation in the data.

## Modeling and Forecasting
- The project employs three forecasting models for both sales and customer counts: ARIMA, ETS, and Prophet.
- Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is used to evaluate model performance, with ETS identified as the most accurate forecasting model.

## Summary
- The summary section provides an overview of the project, highlighting key findings and discussing the significance of model selection.
- Recommendations for future research or improvements are also presented.

## Usage
- The R code and analysis documentation are organized in the repository. Users can follow the analysis step-by-step or modify the code for their specific datasets.

## Requirements
- R environment
- Required R packages: dplyr, tidyverse, ggplot2, zoo, forecast, fable, prophet
